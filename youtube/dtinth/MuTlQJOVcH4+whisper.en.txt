For those who make YouTube videos and want
the video to have English subtitles,

[@5.00]
OpenAI released a model called Whisper.

[@9.00]
It is a model that can listen to sounds in
various languages and create English subtitles.

[@13.00]
OpenAI open-sourced this model,
so anyone can use them for free.

[@19.00]
But to run it, at first we had to set up
various software on the machine.

[@24.00]
And that machine must have a GPU
with a fairly high video RAM.

[@28.00]
In October, @ArthurFDLR made this model
very easy to use through Google Colab.

[@35.00]
Now it can be done in the browser.

[@37.00]
I will show you in this video.

[@39.00]
Start by pressing the Notebook button
in the youtube-whisper page.

[@43.00]
The link is in the description.

[@45.00]
When you press it, you will find
the Google Colab program.

[@48.00]
This page is divided into
several parts called "cells".

[@52.00]
In each cell, there is a "Run" button
we can press to run the code in that cell.

[@57.00]
Let's try to run the code
in the first cell.

[@61.00]
When the cell is finished, you will see
a checkmark on the left

[@65.65]
and the results at the bottom.

[@68.03]
Let's go to the next cell.

[@70.09]
This cell will set up the required tools
on the Colab envorionment.

[@74.58]
Press the Run button and wait.

[@76.87]

[@77.39]
This may take a while.

[@79.26]
When it's done, we can continue.

[@82.19]
I will skip cell 3.

[@83.00]
Cell 4 lets you choose the model size.

[@88.00]
The Colab can run the large size model,
which is the most accurate size.

[@94.00]
So we choose Large
and press the Run button.

[@97.00]
After that, we have to wait for it
to load the model.

[@100.00]
When it's done, we can continue.

[@103.00]
The next step is to choose the video.

[@105.00]
You can paste the YouTube link.

[@107.00]
After that, uncheck the checkbox
next to "store_audio" and press Run.

[@114.00]
When it's done, we will go
to the last cell.

[@117.00]
Select the language spoken in the video.

[@120.00]
In "task", we can choose between
"transcribe" (speech-to-text),

[@126.78]
and "translate" (into English).

[@129.00]
In this example, I want an English
subtitle, so I choose "translate".

[@134.00]
Once ready, press the Run button.

[@137.00]
When we scroll down, we will see
the subtitle slowly showing up.

[@142.00]
Wait for it to work until it's done.

[@145.00]
When it's done, it will create
3 files in our folder.

[@148.00]
We can click on the folder icon on the
left and download the ".vtt" file.

[@156.00]
We can now upload the VTT file
to YouTube for further editing.

[@162.00]
The subtitle that the Whispers generates
has many imperfections.

[@168.00]
We have to fix them ourselves.

[@170.00]
But thanks to the AI-generated subtitles,
my subtitling process is now much faster.
