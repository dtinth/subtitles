[@0.00]
Hello! Today I will talk about…

[@3.75]
GitOps in Weird Places.

[@10.06]
I will introduce myself. My name is Thai.

[@12.00]
I am a software engineer at Eventpop.

[@15.00]
I am in the group called Creatorgarten.

[@19.00]
It is a group of people who are interested
in learning, creating, and so on.

[@24.00]
We organize tech events about things we’re
interested in and want to see happen.

[@31.00]
Most of these events are free events.

[@33.22]
You can follow us on Creatorgarten’s
website and Facebook Page.

[@37.00]
When we organize events —

[@40.48]
Sometimes we run hackathon events.

[@43.00]
Sometimes there are codes involved.

[@47.00]
Almost all of them are
open source on GitHub

[@49.25]
So it can be used as a references
and others can learn from it.

[@54.00]
We have used GitOps a lot
in the Creatorgarten organization.

[@58.00]
What is GitOps?

[@60.38]
Today I will tell you what it is

[@64.96]
and what you can do with it.

[@67.26]
Another name of GitOps is
“Operations by Pull Request.”

[@71.00]
Before I explain,
I will show you the demo.

[@74.00]
We have a Discord server called
Bangkok Open Source Initiative.

[@79.00]
It is a community server
for those who do open source.

[@83.00]
We’re also running the
Bangkok Open Source Hackathon event.

[@86.00]
Actually, tomorrow there
will be a second workshop.

[@89.73]
-

[@93.51]
When we create a community Discord server,

[@98.61]
There must be a #rules channel.

[@104.00]
I don’t know what to put in,

[@106.33]
So I wrote the first rule of the server:

[@108.00]
“Please read the rules.”

[@110.05]
-

[@112.73]
The problem is that no one
can edit my messages.

[@119.00]
Only the person who wrote the message
can edit their own messages.

[@125.00]
If any admin wants to change the rules,
they must ask me to fix it.

[@130.00]
Or they must delete my message
and write a new one.

[@133.00]
Neither way is convenient.

[@135.00]
This is a feature that many admins
are asking for from Discord.

[@142.00]
But 3 years have passed
and we still don’t have this feature.

[@146.00]
But with a GitOps mindset,
I have a solution.

[@151.00]
This is the Discord server.

[@154.00]
This is the server rules.

[@157.00]
You will see that it is not posted by
a human. This is the GitOps bot.

[@160.00]
At the bottom, there will be a link
that says “Edit this text.”

[@164.00]
When you click this link,
it will take you to GitHub.

[@169.00]
This is GitHub.

[@171.00]
There will be a file named “rules.txt.”

[@174.00]
You can go to the edit button.

[@177.00]
You can change the text.

[@179.00]
For example, I put in the word Sunday.

[@183.00]
Sunday, February 26th.

[@186.00]
And click “Commit.”

[@188.00]
When committed, what happens?

[@191.00]
GitHub Action will trigger.

[@195.00]
Go to Actions.

[@197.00]
After that, the action will start working.

[@200.00]
I will skip to this page.

[@202.00]
And it will run the script.

[@204.00]
When the script is finished,
the word “Sunday” will appear.

[@209.80]
-

[@211.81]
Therefore, GitOps is like
using Git as a source of truth.

[@217.00]
Hope you get a better picture.

[@220.00]
But we haven’t really defined it.

[@223.00]
What is GitOps?

[@225.00]
Let’s look at the history.

[@227.00]
It was created in 2017

[@231.86]
By a company called Weaveworks.

[@234.00]
If you read the article
“The history of GitOps”

[@237.00]
It will tell you that in 2016,

[@241.00]
An engineer tried to deploy
a change to the system.

[@247.75]
If it works, it’s okay.

[@249.97]
But if it doesn’t work, it
“could wipe out the entire system.”

[@254.00]
Well, “the system was wiped out.”

[@256.00]
But something really cool happened.

[@261.00]
“the Weaveworks team was able to bring
the system back up in about 40 minutes”

[@266.00]
They are “pleased with their progress.”

[@270.00]
“the team sat together and
made a list of these principles”

[@275.00]
And the CEO realized that

[@278.68]
“one word that describes
all of this was ‘GitOps.’”

[@285.00]
So they tried to describe
“the principles of GitOps.”

[@288.00]
Later, it became a project
called OpenGitOps.

[@292.00]
Let’s see what it has to say.

[@298.66]
“GitOps is a set of principles for
operating and managing software systems.”

[@305.00]
GitOps is usually used
in the context of Kubernetes.

[@311.00]
Because it’s where GitOps comes from.

[@314.00]
The most popular tools in the world of
Kubernetes are Flux and ArgoCD.

[@319.00]
But I don’t use Kubernetes.

[@322.00]
Running a Kubernetes cluster
can be expensive.

[@326.00]
I usually use serverless.

[@329.00]
The good thing about serverless is that —

[@332.10]
-

[@334.41]
In the talk before this one,
Smith talks about serverless.

[@337.00]
I really like the Logic Apps.

[@340.00]
I tried creating a Function App before.

[@342.43]
When prototyping, sometimes I forgot
a comma and the function crashed.

[@346.78]
Sometimes I put in the wrong parameter,
deploy it, and get a 500 error.

[@352.00]
Logic App seems like an easier option,
it feels like the Shortcuts app.

[@357.00]
I’ll try it out!

[@360.00]
Thank you for selling it.

[@363.00]
I like serverless because my personal
projects and Creatorsgarten’s projects —

[@368.24]
They do not have many users.
No need to scale to the masses.

[@371.13]
Running servers can be expensive.

[@373.00]
But with serverless —
last month, I paid Azure

[@375.55]
A total of one dollar.

[@378.28]
(Audience from Microsoft) Thank you.

[@380.38]
It’s very cost-effective
to use serverless in my case.

[@385.00]
Let’s talk about GitOps.

[@388.00]
OpenGitOps has 4 principles.

[@392.00]
Let’s see what are the 4 principles.

[@395.00]
The first one is “Declarative.”

[@399.00]
This principle says that the system
that we will manage with GitOps —

[@403.00]
First, we have to explain what we want.

[@408.00]
They use the word “desired state.”

[@411.00]
It’s like a description of the situation
that we want our system to be in.

[@417.00]
For example,

[@419.45]
The rules.txt file describes
“what should be in the #rules channel.”

[@426.00]
Next, “Versioned and Immutable.”

[@429.00]
We have to put this file
in a version control system.

[@434.00]
This file is stored on GitHub.

[@437.00]
Next, “Pulled Automatically.”

[@440.00]
There must be a software agent

[@443.58]
That pulls this declaration automatically.

[@449.00]
The moment I push to GitHub,

[@451.38]
GitHub Action automatically runs.

[@454.00]
The last one is “Continuously Reconciled.”

[@458.00]
There must be a software agent
that checks the current state

[@465.00]
And compare it with what we want.

[@467.00]
And make it consistent.

[@469.00]
And do it continuously.

[@473.00]
These are the 4 principles.

[@475.00]
In this example,

[@476.22]
A script run by GitHub Actions
will update the message in Discord

[@480.00]
To match the declaration in Git.

[@482.00]
There are 2 main ways to implement GitOps.

[@488.00]
Push-based and pull-based.

[@490.00]
Both ways are viable.

[@492.00]
Push-based is like we have a system
that is just sits there.

[@498.00]
If we don’t do anything to it,
it will stay the same.

[@501.00]
But what we do is we put our
config files in a GitHub repo.

[@507.00]
And as soon as we push,

[@509.10]
A CI process will start working.

[@512.00]
And it will make change to the system

[@515.00]
As we desired.

[@518.00]
This means that our CI process

[@522.09]
Must hold a key that gives it
permission to change the system.

[@529.00]
It means that our system must open a way
for external systems, like the CI,

[@534.64]
To make changes to it.

[@536.00]
Some people sees it as a security risk.

[@540.00]
Especially if it’s Kubernetes.

[@542.00]
Some people put the cluster in a VPC.

[@545.00]
And external CI can’t connect to it.

[@548.00]
In short — the Kubernetes community seems
to not prefer the push-based approach.

[@553.00]
If we’re in the Kubernetes world,
we’ll mostly use a pull-base solution.

[@559.00]
What is pull-based?

[@561.00]
We put a “GitOps operator” in the system.

[@566.00]
And GitOps operator will
pull the code from GitHub

[@569.00]
And make changes to the system.

[@573.00]
The good thing is that everything
happens inside the system.

[@576.00]
You don’t have to set up
anything complicated.

[@580.00]
Although setting up Kubernetes
can be complicated in and of itself.

[@583.00]
Everything happens in the system.

[@586.00]
The first Discord example I showed you
is usinga a push-based approach.

[@590.00]
Let’s look at this
from an even higher level.

[@595.00]
You can see that GitOps
consists of 3 main parts.

[@601.00]
The leftmost part is Git

[@604.60]
It keeps the desired state

[@606.00]
That describes what condition
we want our system to be in.

[@610.00]
On the right is the actual system.

[@613.00]
And in the center is a
reconciliation system.

[@617.00]
It reconciles the left side
and the right side.

[@620.00]
It adjusts the right side
to what we want on the left.

[@624.00]
How do we create a reconciler?

[@628.00]
The answer is it depends.

[@631.00]
It depends on how you use it.

[@633.00]
If you use Kubernetes,
you can use Argo or Flux.

[@636.00]
As for other cases, we’ll see.

[@638.00]
First example — cloud infrastructure

[@641.00]
Such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.

[@645.00]
If we do manual operation?

[@648.00]
If we don’t have GitOps yet,
how do we do manual operation?

[@651.00]
Go to the Portal and do things one by one.

[@654.00]
Review, Create, Create,

[@672.00]
Assign to the group and attach to the group.

[@676.00]
Or create a service account, create a key, etc.

[@680.00]
If we do many of these, this is an easy example.

[@686.00]
If we do many of these, it’s very easy.

[@688.00]
I don’t have many examples.

[@690.00]
I don’t have an advanced system.

[@692.00]
So I stole the slide first.

[@694.00]
Thank you, Khun Pong, for letting me steal the slide.

[@702.00]
There are many customers, right?

[@705.00]
You have to take care of the system a lot.

[@707.00]
If we have a lot of systems, one way to fix it is to do scripts and do automation.

[@715.00]
For example, I use Azure CLI to create resources.

[@720.00]
As I showed you earlier.

[@722.00]
The problem is that this script can only be created.

[@725.00]
If you want to delete it, you have to write another script.

[@727.00]
And if I create and there’s something wrong, what should I do?

[@731.00]
I might have to delete it.

[@733.00]
I might have to run the script and then run the script to create.

[@735.00]
And sometimes if we run the creation command and it dies in the middle of the way,

[@739.00]
When we run it again, we can’t run it again because the object is created in the middle.

[@745.00]
We have to delete it and then create a new one.

[@747.00]
This is a problem of running scripts.

[@750.00]
But as far as I’ve tested, this script doesn’t have any problems.

[@755.00]
Because Azure has designed that if we create what we have and all the parameters are the same, it will be considered successful.

[@762.00]
Now let’s see what GitOps is.

[@766.00]
If we use GitOps, back to the first principle.

[@772.00]
We have to be able to explain our system in a declarative way.

[@777.00]
I don’t know how to translate it to be declarative.

[@781.00]
Can anyone translate it for me?

[@783.00]
What is declarative in Thai?

[@785.00]
It’s pronounced.

[@787.00]
The opposite word is imperative.

[@791.00]
It’s like a command.

[@793.00]
Thank you very much.

[@795.00]
Because in the slides, I didn’t prepare at all.

[@798.00]
How to translate it into Thai.

[@800.00]
But I’ll give you an example.

[@802.00]
If imperative, we tell you what to do, right?

[@807.00]
It’s like a step.

[@809.00]
Create this, create that, create this.

[@811.00]
Imperative is telling you what to do.

[@814.00]
Or script is imperative too.

[@817.00]
If you look at it from a different perspective, declarative.

[@821.00]
We don’t tell you how to do it.

[@823.00]
We just tell you what we want.

[@825.00]
We want a resource group with a lock analytic workspace that is linked to this resource group.

[@829.00]
This is what we want.

[@833.00]
How do we set it?

[@835.00]
Let’s think for yourself.

[@837.00]
Can we transform this image into a code?

[@840.00]
Sure.

[@842.00]
If it’s Azure, it will have its own language.

[@844.00]
It’s BISEP, right?

[@846.00]
But if we don’t want to stick with Cloud,

[@848.00]
We can use the tools of Terraform.

[@851.00]
The other one I’m using is Purumi.

[@854.00]
Purumi allows us to write everything we want.

[@860.00]
By using TypeScript.

[@862.00]
I’m a developer in JavaScript.

[@864.00]
So I use TypeScript.

[@866.00]
You don’t have to learn new syntax.

[@868.00]
The second thing is TypeScript.

[@870.00]
It has a very good model training.

[@872.00]
It’s GitHub Copilot.

[@874.00]
GitHub Copilot has a lot of model training in TypeScript.

[@879.00]
It makes everything we write, like we want a lock container.

[@885.00]
We want to key it out.

[@887.00]
It writes it for you.

[@889.00]
All of this,

[@891.00]
GitHub Copilot writes it all.

[@893.00]
Okay.

[@895.00]
So we have the desired state.

[@898.00]
It’s Purumi.

[@900.00]
I push it up to GitHub.

[@902.00]
GitHub Action works.

[@904.00]
And GitHub Action orders Purumi up.

[@906.00]
Purumi compares what we want.

[@910.00]
This file.

[@912.00]
What’s in it?

[@914.00]
Nothing.

[@916.00]
It has a plan.

[@918.00]
What to create.

[@920.00]
And it will apply it to our Cloud.

[@923.00]
Let’s say I cut this part.

[@925.00]
Cut it off.

[@927.00]
And we push it up again.

[@929.00]
What happens?

[@931.00]
It knows that we wrote two things.

[@934.00]
But in the real system, there are three things.

[@936.00]
We have to delete this.

[@938.00]
It will delete it.

[@940.00]
So for Cloud Infrastructure,

[@944.00]
I suggest that you don’t write reconciliation engine.

[@947.00]
Because it’s very complex.

[@949.00]
Sometimes we have to create one before two, two before three.

[@952.00]
It’s a mess.

[@954.00]
And the handle case is not enough.

[@956.00]
We have to fix and delete the handle case.

[@958.00]
It’s good to use the tools we have.

[@960.00]
Okay.

[@962.00]
We have already created the Cloud Infrastructure.

[@965.00]
What else can we create?

[@967.00]
We can use GitOps with GitHub.

[@972.00]
If I’m in an organization and I’m not an admin.

[@977.00]
When I want to have a team or a repo.

[@980.00]
I have to ask the admin to help me create this team.

[@983.00]
And we create a repository.

[@985.00]
Add 7 people and write access.

[@989.00]
The admin will invite 7 people.

[@993.00]
Follow the steps.

[@995.00]
And then come back and say okay.

[@998.00]
It turns out that there are 8 people.

[@1000.00]
I have to go back to the same loop.

[@1002.00]
But in this case,

[@1004.00]
We have a GitHub provider.

[@1007.00]
And when it’s a TypeScript,

[@1010.00]
We can use a code that’s long.

[@1012.00]
Extract it into a function.

[@1014.00]
I can write code like this.

[@1017.00]
This is the real code.

[@1019.00]
In the repository.

[@1021.00]
In the organization of Creator’s Garden.

[@1023.00]
You will see that it’s just one button.

[@1026.00]
To add people.

[@1028.00]
And when it’s a pattern like this.

[@1030.00]
Anyone who wants to join the project.

[@1032.00]
You can send a pull request.

[@1034.00]
It’s an operation by pull request.

[@1036.00]
The function like function team.

[@1038.00]
Function write access.

[@1040.00]
We’ll write it to call the pull.

[@1044.00]
When I push GitHub,

[@1050.00]
I get a team.

[@1052.00]
We have a GitHub team.

[@1054.00]
And you can push the code.

[@1057.00]
In the group of Creator’s Garden.

[@1059.00]
We are a group that is quite open.

[@1062.00]
We tell everyone that.

[@1064.00]
If anyone has ever come to the event of Creator’s Garden.

[@1066.00]
You can join the club.

[@1069.00]
By sending a pull request to this file.

[@1071.00]
And then put your own GitHub name in.

[@1074.00]
Which this file has only this list.

[@1077.00]
If anyone wants to apply.

[@1079.00]
They know what to do.

[@1081.00]
Open pull request and add a button.

[@1083.00]
Send the information like this.

[@1085.00]
Send PR.

[@1087.00]
When we accept.

[@1089.00]
The system of pull me.

[@1091.00]
Send invite to you.

[@1093.00]
Now our group has 41 people.

[@1095.00]
And then we become an organization.

[@1098.00]
Which has active users on GitHub.

[@1101.00]
Is the number one in Thailand.

[@1103.00]
Besides this.

[@1108.00]
The second principle of GitOps.

[@1112.00]
We have to put our design state.

[@1116.00]
In the place where it is version control.

[@1118.00]
So we can see.

[@1120.00]
What’s going on in our organization.

[@1122.00]
What is this?

[@1124.00]
I invited Nong Pup to join the organization.

[@1131.00]
But Nong Pup answered the invitation.

[@1134.00]
Not in time in 7 days.

[@1136.00]
So I have to do something.

[@1138.00]
I have to kick him out of the organization.

[@1140.00]
To invite him back.

[@1142.00]
Like this.

[@1144.00]
This is the second example.

[@1146.00]
The third example.

[@1148.00]
Can we use GitOps with the website?

[@1150.00]
If anyone has ever used GitHub page.

[@1152.00]
You may be familiar with it.

[@1154.00]
Because we push GitHub page.

[@1156.00]
For a while.

[@1158.00]
It will be deployed as a web.

[@1160.00]
I tried to see.

[@1162.00]
I feel that GitHub page.

[@1164.00]
It’s all four of GitOps.

[@1166.00]
It helps developers.

[@1168.00]
To do GitOps since 2008.

[@1170.00]
That is 9 years ago.

[@1172.00]
When the word GitOps was born.

[@1174.00]
Or if we use NetRefine.

[@1176.00]
Sometimes we have a domain.

[@1178.00]
And we want to do URL Redirection.

[@1180.00]
Normally we have to use Bidly.

[@1182.00]
Or something like this.

[@1184.00]
We have to pay.

[@1186.00]
Or Firebase Dynamic Link.

[@1188.00]
So we have to invite him.

[@1190.00]
To take care of it alone.

[@1192.00]
But we can use the redirect file.

[@1194.00]
On the Git.

[@1196.00]
So we can define.

[@1198.00]
Which URL to redirect to.

[@1200.00]
This is using NetRefine.

[@1202.00]
Next.

[@1204.00]
Domain name.

[@1206.00]
Can domain name take care of it?

[@1208.00]
With GitOps.

[@1210.00]
This is a real chat example.

[@1212.00]
I talked to Phum.

[@1214.00]
Because Phum is the one who holds the domain.

[@1216.00]
I want to add a CNAME.

[@1218.00]
But I don’t have admin access.

[@1220.00]
I have to send an access like this.

[@1222.00]
Okay.

[@1226.00]
There is another domain that I wrote.

[@1228.00]
Source.in.th

[@1230.00]
I think.

[@1232.00]
I want this domain to be easy to take care of.

[@1234.00]
So I use GitOps.

[@1236.00]
What I did is.

[@1238.00]
I created a repo called source.in.th.

[@1240.00]
Like this.

[@1242.00]
But this time I didn’t use Purumi.

[@1244.00]
I think my use case is very simple.

[@1246.00]
I don’t have to use Purumi.

[@1248.00]
Because when I set Purumi.

[@1250.00]
I have to set up a state.

[@1252.00]
I have to set up an account.

[@1254.00]
But Cloudflare.

[@1256.00]
There is an API that is very easy to use.

[@1258.00]
Create API key and shoot.

[@1260.00]
And then.

[@1262.00]
DNS record.

[@1264.00]
Because it depends on each other.

[@1266.00]
So when creating and deleting.

[@1268.00]
It’s not difficult.

[@1270.00]
I created a GitHub workflow.

[@1272.00]
When I push it, I let it run.

[@1274.00]
The name of the command is update.mjs.

[@1276.00]
This file update.mjs.

[@1278.00]
The topmost.

[@1280.00]
It will be.

[@1282.00]
DNS record that we want to have.

[@1284.00]
And below.

[@1286.00]
It’s a script that contains everything.

[@1288.00]
I’m going to check.

[@1290.00]
What records are there?

[@1292.00]
What do I have to add?

[@1294.00]
The bottom is.

[@1296.00]
The task that it occurs.

[@1298.00]
Order to run.

[@1300.00]
Actually, there is a code below.

[@1302.00]
It’s a code that calls Cloudflare API.

[@1304.00]
Just shoot.

[@1306.00]
No need to use any dependencies.

[@1308.00]
You can use the node.js.

[@1310.00]
When we have.

[@1312.00]
DNS record written in GitHub.

[@1314.00]
Like this.

[@1316.00]
It makes it possible for someone to send.

[@1318.00]
Puriquests.

[@1320.00]
Nong Liffy.

[@1322.00]
Send Puriquests.

[@1324.00]
Create subdomain.

[@1326.00]
Lam.source.in.th

[@1328.00]
I tried to press it.

[@1330.00]
When I pressed it, I found Hell Kitchen.

[@1332.00]
And asked.

[@1334.00]
Where’s the lam source?

[@1336.00]
You will see that.

[@1338.00]
GitOps.

[@1340.00]
It makes everyone contribute.

[@1342.00]
Even if you’re not in.

[@1344.00]
Even if you’re not an admin.

[@1346.00]
You can open Puriquests.

[@1348.00]
You can participate in the project.

[@1350.00]
Work.

[@1352.00]
I wrote this.

[@1354.00]
I’ll give you an example.

[@1356.00]
How to write a reconciler.

[@1358.00]
First, load.

[@1360.00]
What do we want it to look like?

[@1362.00]
Two, it’s a query.

[@1364.00]
What is the current look like?

[@1366.00]
Three, let’s compare.

[@1368.00]
Here, let’s compare like this.

[@1370.00]
When compared, we will know.

[@1372.00]
What to create, what to delete, what to fix.

[@1374.00]
And we’ll apply it to the real system.

[@1376.00]
It will be like this.

[@1378.00]
Example 5.

[@1382.00]
Discord server.

[@1384.00]
This is the demo at the beginning.

[@1386.00]
I’ll show you how I created it.

[@1388.00]
I wrote the script myself.

[@1390.00]
In the channel, we can create what we call webhooks.

[@1392.00]
When creating webhooks.

[@1394.00]
Webhooks will connect to the channel.

[@1396.00]
We will have a URL.

[@1398.00]
We can use this URL to shoot HTTP.

[@1400.00]
Post content.

[@1402.00]
When sending content, the bot will post.

[@1404.00]
This time, it will return the ID value.

[@1406.00]
We can use this ID to shoot HTTP.

[@1408.00]
It will be used to fix the message.

[@1410.00]
It’s easy.

[@1412.00]
I wrote the script.

[@1414.00]
This is script 34.

[@1416.00]
It reads the file root and text.

[@1418.00]
We’ll split it.

[@1420.00]
Split it into a few messages.

[@1422.00]
And shoot the patch.

[@1424.00]
Put the ID in.

[@1426.00]
Something like this.

[@1428.00]
It’s convenient.

[@1430.00]
It’s convenient.

[@1432.00]
It’s convenient.

[@1434.00]
This time, the script I wrote is simpler than the previous one.

[@1442.00]
Because it just loads what we want it to be.

[@1444.00]
And write what we want.

[@1446.00]
No need to check the original.

[@1448.00]
How it looks like.

[@1450.00]
You can replace it like this.

[@1452.00]
This time, when I did it.

[@1456.00]
I wrote something.

[@1458.00]
It’s easy.

[@1460.00]
I wrote a message.

[@1462.00]
Someone contributed.

[@1464.00]
I don’t know how to manage Discord server.

[@1466.00]
I don’t know what to add.

[@1468.00]
Someone contributed.

[@1470.00]
They added a button.

[@1472.00]
As a server member.

[@1474.00]
No need to be an admin.

[@1476.00]
You can help write the button for our server.

[@1478.00]
I have to thank Khun Khanyanit J.

[@1482.00]
If you use Terraform.

[@1488.00]
There’s a Discord provider.

[@1490.00]
If you don’t want to fix only messages.

[@1492.00]
You can create and manage

[@1494.00]
the low channel categories.

[@1496.00]
Through Terraform.

[@1498.00]
If you want to find it, you can do it.

[@1500.00]
The last example.

[@1504.00]
YouTube channel.

[@1506.00]
Can we take care of it?

[@1508.00]
This one.

[@1510.00]
This is Creator’s Garden channel.

[@1512.00]
We set up take-meet-ups.

[@1514.00]
And take-meet-ups.

[@1516.00]
When someone presents.

[@1518.00]
After we go live.

[@1520.00]
We cut the clips.

[@1522.00]
And upload to YouTube channel.

[@1524.00]
There are only 150 subscribers.

[@1526.00]
It’s a new channel.

[@1528.00]
You can subscribe first.

[@1530.00]
Now.

[@1532.00]
Each video.

[@1534.00]
I want it to have a description.

[@1536.00]
In a similar format.

[@1538.00]
This is the description.

[@1540.00]
If you have to write it yourself.

[@1542.00]
It’s exhausting.

[@1544.00]
If you want to automate it.

[@1546.00]
It’s not just this.

[@1548.00]
Talk, description, timestamp.

[@1550.00]
If you want the logo clip to be inter.

[@1552.00]
You have to have an English description.

[@1554.00]
Localization.

[@1556.00]
If you use YouTube.

[@1558.00]
English version.

[@1560.00]
You will get an English description.

[@1562.00]
Some talks.

[@1566.00]
If the owner of the talk has time.

[@1568.00]
Put the English subtitle.

[@1570.00]
You can upload the subtitle.

[@1572.00]
And.

[@1574.00]
Besides this.

[@1576.00]
Talk’s name.

[@1578.00]
If we use the name of the talk to be the clip name.

[@1580.00]
It’s not clickable.

[@1582.00]
We have to make it possible.

[@1584.00]
Customize the clip’s name.

[@1586.00]
And put it in English.

[@1588.00]
Finally.

[@1590.00]
Thumbnail.

[@1592.00]
All of these.

[@1594.00]
You can fix it all.

[@1596.00]
There are many speakers in our group.

[@1598.00]
But not all speakers.

[@1600.00]
We have to make it accessible.

[@1602.00]
So we think.

[@1604.00]
We can make anyone contribute.

[@1606.00]
Like I said.

[@1608.00]
Everything is on GitHub.

[@1610.00]
It’s a report called

[@1612.00]
Creator’s Garden / Videos.

[@1614.00]
In each folder.

[@1616.00]
There will be talks.

[@1618.00]
There will be file.md that stores metadata.

[@1620.00]
It’s a yaml like this.

[@1622.00]
And.

[@1624.00]
The top is a jpeg file.

[@1626.00]
It’s a thumbnail of the clip.

[@1628.00]
And the bottom is a subtitle file.

[@1630.00]
When I made the pipeline.

[@1634.00]
There was a problem.

[@1636.00]
YouTube API.

[@1638.00]
There’s a quota to shoot API.

[@1640.00]
If we shoot a lot of API.

[@1642.00]
The quota is full.

[@1644.00]
Another thing.

[@1646.00]
There’s no YouTube provider.

[@1648.00]
Which is.

[@1650.00]
It’s understandable.

[@1652.00]
Why there’s no.

[@1654.00]
So I have to write.

[@1656.00]
I have to write a compiler.

[@1658.00]
The technique is.

[@1660.00]
I created what is called a local database.

[@1662.00]
The same principle.

[@1664.00]
But instead of checking.

[@1666.00]
By curing YouTube API.

[@1668.00]
We curate the database.

[@1670.00]
Which is our local.

[@1672.00]
So.

[@1674.00]
The first and second.

[@1676.00]
Just curate the local database.

[@1678.00]
And we’ll get the same change.

[@1680.00]
And we’ll apply it to the real system.

[@1682.00]
And when it’s applied to the real system.

[@1684.00]
We can update our local database.

[@1686.00]
This time.

[@1688.00]
Where do you keep the local database?

[@1690.00]
I keep it in the grid.

[@1692.00]
There’s a file called YouTube Sync.yml.

[@1694.00]
It will keep all the states.

[@1696.00]
For example.

[@1698.00]
When there’s an update of the thumbnail file.

[@1700.00]
I’ll keep the hash.

[@1702.00]
In the future.

[@1704.00]
If the file changes.

[@1706.00]
We can compare the hash with the state.

[@1708.00]
We’ll get it.

[@1710.00]
If it doesn’t change.

[@1712.00]
The subtitle is the same.

[@1714.00]
Including metadata.

[@1716.00]
Make it possible to compare.

[@1718.00]
Compare the content on the channel.

[@1720.00]
And what we want it to be.

[@1722.00]
Without having to shoot YouTube API.

[@1724.00]
Finally, when we upload the caption.

[@1726.00]
On YouTube API.

[@1728.00]
It will give you the ID back.

[@1730.00]
If you go back to the previous slide.

[@1732.00]
You’ll see that.

[@1734.00]
Just listing.

[@1736.00]
What video has caption.

[@1738.00]
It’s been 50 points.

[@1740.00]
I have to keep the ID.

[@1742.00]
In the local state.

[@1744.00]
When we update the caption.

[@1746.00]
We can update it.

[@1748.00]
Without having to go to the Qly API.

[@1750.00]
What does it mean?

[@1752.00]
When I publish the video.

[@1754.00]
When I publish the video.

[@1756.00]
I just fix the false and true here.

[@1758.00]
When the action is done.

[@1760.00]
It will update the database.

[@1762.00]
From the privacy that is unlisted.

[@1764.00]
To public.

[@1766.00]
I’ll show you.

[@1768.00]
It will be like this.

[@1770.00]
This time.

[@1772.00]
When we have a new video.

[@1774.00]
What do we do?

[@1776.00]
I uploaded the video on YouTube.

[@1778.00]
But I didn’t put any description.

[@1780.00]
No data.

[@1782.00]
Then I copied the URL.

[@1784.00]
When I copied the URL.

[@1786.00]
I ordered the script.

[@1788.00]
To import.

[@1790.00]
Put the URL in.

[@1792.00]
Put the name.

[@1794.00]
Information about which event.

[@1796.00]
Then it will generate this file.

[@1800.00]
These JPEG files.

[@1802.00]
It’s a thumbnail that YouTube generates.

[@1804.00]
Import it.

[@1806.00]
Then.

[@1808.00]
There will be a template file.

[@1810.00]
I’ll put the information in.

[@1812.00]
Like this.

[@1814.00]
Then I run the sync command.

[@1816.00]
The sync command.

[@1818.00]
It will preview.

[@1820.00]
From the information in the KIT.

[@1822.00]
Now.

[@1824.00]
What changes will happen to our channel?

[@1826.00]
It will say.

[@1828.00]
We have to update.

[@1830.00]
We have to update.

[@1832.00]
The description of this video.

[@1834.00]
The status is unlisted.

[@1836.00]
Because it’s not public yet.

[@1838.00]
Because the database.

[@1840.00]
The local database is in the same report.

[@1842.00]
We can run this command.

[@1844.00]
Even if we don’t have access.

[@1846.00]
To the YouTube API.

[@1848.00]
It can preview everything.

[@1850.00]
Then we take the same step.

[@1852.00]
The same step.

[@1854.00]
KIT.

[@1856.00]
When KIT HUB action works.

[@1858.00]
When you press refresh.

[@1860.00]
It will be like this.

[@1862.00]
Description of everything.

[@1864.00]
Or the original thumbnail.

[@1866.00]
We will crop a frame.

[@1868.00]
And put it in.

[@1870.00]
Done.

[@1872.00]
Then it will.

[@1874.00]
Write the status file.

[@1876.00]
Write in KIT HUB.

[@1878.00]
It will upload tomorrow.

[@1880.00]
It will update tomorrow.

[@1882.00]
So.

[@1884.00]
About opening a YouTube channel.

[@1886.00]
I don’t have much experience.

[@1888.00]
And.

[@1890.00]
But I know.

[@1892.00]
There are people who can take care of the YouTube channel.

[@1894.00]
There are people who know better than me.

[@1896.00]
Those people should have the power.

[@1902.00]
In taking care of our YouTube.

[@1906.00]
Using KIT OPS.

[@1908.00]
I think it’s a good way.

[@1912.00]
To empower.

[@1914.00]
To empower people in the community.

[@1916.00]
To create things together.

[@1918.00]
So.

[@1920.00]
When I think of KIT OPS.

[@1924.00]
I look at the system.

[@1926.00]
I see KIT OPS.

[@1928.00]
I may ask.

[@1930.00]
What else can we do with KIT OPS?

[@1932.00]
It’s over.

[@1934.00]
Thank you very much.

[@1936.00]
[Applause]
